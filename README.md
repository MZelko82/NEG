# Novel Exploration Growth (NEG)

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the project associated with the publication **"Novel Exploration Growth Quantifies Anxiety-like Behaviour in the Elevated Plus Maze"**. This repository contains the code and data analysis tools used in the research.

## Repository Overview

- **NEG_Calc:** Processes XY coordinate time series data into NEG time series for the total maze and by arm type (Open, Closed)

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to introduce and quantify a new metric called Novel Exploration Growth (NEG) to assess anxiety-like behavior in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM). The NEG metric offers a detailed analysis of exploration behavior, which can be utilized in various behavioral studies.

## Key Features

- **Pre-processing:** Pre-process coordinates into Novel Exploration Growth over time
- **Bayesian Change-point Analysis** Localise change-points into time series to evaluate phasic nature of exploration
- **Bayesian Generalised Additive Model Analysis** Compare effects of interest using GAM models

## Usage

The code and analysis tools will be provided soon. Instructions on how to use the code and interpret the results will also be included.

# Novel Exploration Growth (NEG)

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the project associated with the publication **"Novel Exploration Growth Quantifies Anxiety-like Behaviour in the Elevated Plus Maze"**. This repository contains the code and data analysis tools used in the research.

## Repository Overview

This repository is currently under development, and the code will be made available soon. Stay tuned for updates.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to introduce and quantify a new metric called Novel Exploration Growth (NEG) to assess anxiety-like behavior in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM). The NEG metric offers a detailed analysis of exploration behavior, which can be utilized in various behavioral studies.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Tools for analyzing exploration behavior in the Elevated Plus Maze.
- **Visualization:** Methods to visualize the exploration patterns and results.
- **Quantification:** Metrics to quantify anxiety-like behavior based on exploration growth.

## Usage

The code and analysis tools will be provided soon. Instructions on how to use the code and interpret the results will also be included.
